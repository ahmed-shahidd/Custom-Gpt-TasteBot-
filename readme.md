```

> **Note:** If you encounter missing package errors, install them manually as suggested in [guide.txt](../Requirements/guide.txt).

### 3. Prepare Configuration

- Add your `config.json` file with your Hugging Face token:
    ```json
    {
      "HF_TOKEN": "your_huggingface_token"
    }
    ```
- Place your datasets (PDF, CSV, TXT, JSON) in the appropriate paths and update the file paths in the code.

## Datasets & Model Training

- **Custom Datasets:** You must provide your own datasets for training (PDF, CSV, TXT, JSON).
- **Model Training:** The code supports fine-tuning GPT-2 models using Hugging Face Transformers and Datasets libraries.
- **Model Export:** Fine-tuned models are saved locally and can be uploaded to Hugging Face Hub for sharing or deployment.

---

## Customization

- **Add More Models:** Fine-tune additional models and add their paths to the `model_dirs` list in the code.
- **UI Customization:** Modify the Gradio Blocks section for a personalized look and feel.
- **Prompt Templates:** Adjust the prompt templates for different user types in the `get_response` function.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Packages:** Install any missing packages as indicated by error messages.
- **CUDA/CPU Issues:** The code automatically falls back to CPU if CUDA is unavailable.
- **Model Loading Errors:** Ensure your Hugging Face token is valid and models are accessible.
